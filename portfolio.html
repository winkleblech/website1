    <h4> We created a program using python allowing you to collect burger elements on a bun. <h4>
    <h4> You get to choose the order and which elements you want in your burger including tomatos, <h4>
    <h4> cheese, onions, lettuce, and patties. There is a score to see how many the user can collect. <h4>
    <h4> At the end a leaderboard is shown and the user gets to see if they had a high enough score.<h4>
