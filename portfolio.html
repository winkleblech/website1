    <h3> We created a program using python allowing you to customize the colors of the bear <h3>
    <h3> and add accessories. The color of the accessories, which are a bow tie, glasses, and <h3>
    <h3> a bucket hat, can also be chosen. A pre-made banjo can also be added. <h3>

    <h4> We created a program using python allowing you to collect burger elements on a bun. <h4>
    <h4> You get to choose the order and which elements you want in your burger including tomatos, <h4>
    <h4> cheese, onions, lettuce, and patties. There is a score to see how many the user can collect. <h4>
    <h4> At the end a leaderboard is shown and the user gets to see if they had a high enough score.<h4>

    <h4> We created a scratch game using starfish sprites, an ocean background, a score, and <h4>
    <h4> displaying the highest score. Two starfish are boucing across the screen and the user <h4>
    <h4> has to use a green horizontal pong paddle to bounce the starfish away from the red line <h4>
    <h4> on the bottom. Once one starfish hits the bottom, the game terminates high score is recorded. <h4>

    <h4> We believe that the rover is located in the Rocky Mountains terrain. We reached this conclusion <h4>
    <h4> by creating predicted graphs for each of the 4 elements for each of the 5 terrains. From there, <h4>
    <h4> we created graphs from the actual data collected. By comparing the actual and predicted graphs, <h4>
    <h4> we were able to notice similarites and determine which graph represented wind, sound, light, and <h4>
    <h4> temperature. This further allowed us to realize how the rocky mountain terrain graphs matched up <h4>
    <h4> the best out of the 4 other terrains. </h4>

    <h4> My two partners and I evaluated the production of honey by inputing data and code given to us <h4>
    <h4> from pltw 3.2.4 into replit. The outcome resulted in many graphs, including linear and bar graphs. </h4>

    <h4> For our Final AP CPS project, we chose the Autumn simulation from NetLogo. It showed how trees, <h4>
    <h4> more specifically leaves, are affected during the season of Autumn. Above is our presentation. </h4>
