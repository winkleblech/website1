    <h3> We created a program using python allowing you to customize the colors of the bear <h3>
    <h3> and add accessories. The color of the accessories, which are a bow tie, glasses, and <h3>
    <h3> a bucket hat, can also be chosen. A pre-made banjo can also be added. <h3>

    <h4> We created a program using python allowing you to collect burger elements on a bun. <h4>
    <h4> You get to choose the order and which elements you want in your burger including tomatos, <h4>
    <h4> cheese, onions, lettuce, and patties. There is a score to see how many the user can collect. <h4>
    <h4> At the end a leaderboard is shown and the user gets to see if they had a high enough score.<h4>

    <h4> We created a scratch game using starfish sprites, an ocean background, a score, and <h4>
    <h4> displaying the highest score. Two starfish are boucing across the screen and the user <h54>
    <h4> has to use a green horizontal pong paddle to bounce the starfish away from the red line <h4>
    <h4> on the bottom. Once one starfish hits the bottom, the game terminates high score is recorded. <h4>
